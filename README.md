BUGS: 
 The address doesn't change when pressing enter, meaning that the code it's hard to read, and can lead to malfunctions.
 - Between logging and the main page, there is an unwanted time that may be unpleasant for the customer. This is because the script is in front of the body.
 - When using the search feature without putting any characters, the div.movie gets empty.
 - There are movies without pieces of information or images.

IMPROVEMENTS:
 - The title, "Top Movie", should be a home button that resets all the results.
